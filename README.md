🍽️ Recipe Reviews – Sentiment Classification & Score Prediction
📌 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing recipe reviews data to understand user sentiment and predict review scores using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The notebook demonstrates a complete end-to-end ML workflow—from preprocessing raw text to training and evaluating high-performing models.
🔍 Key Highlights

Performed text preprocessing and NLP feature extraction on large-scale recipe review data.

Built models for sentiment classification and review score prediction.

Achieved strong performance across multiple evaluation metrics, demonstrating model robustness.

Converted a regression task into a binary classification problem to further improve prediction accuracy.
🧠 Methodology

Cleaned and preprocessed raw textual reviews (tokenization, normalization, vectorization).

Generated Word2Vec embeddings to capture semantic meaning from review text.

Applied both classification and regression approaches to solve different problem formulations.

Evaluated models using business-relevant metrics rather than accuracy alone.
